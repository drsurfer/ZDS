 This program inserts new tabs wherever possible into ASCII text files
 or .ASM source code files.  It counts the original tabs as well as the
 new tabs.  When the file is finished it then displays the original and
 current tab count.  The tabs are placed for standard CP/M intervals of
 "every eight" columns.  It pads the end of the file with CTL-Z (end of
 file) characters.  It also removes any trailing spaces or tabs.

 It optionally selects between ASCII text or .ASM source code files.
 The text version does not put a tab if there is only one space, as
 nothing would be gained.  The .ASM source code version puts a tab at
 any location it can until it comes to a semicolon (delimiter for text
 comments).  It will still tabulate in the text comments, but does not
 substitute a tab for a single space as nothing would be gained.  The
 .ASM version also protects the space between 'quotes' and does not re-
 place any spaces with tabs.  TABS is likely the most intelligent of
 any such program.

 NOTE: The line count progress is displayed near the left margin.  This
       is controlled by byte 0103.  Change to 0F (every 16), 1F (every
       32) or 3F (every 64) lines to match the speed of your equiment.
       Then save 8 pages.

 NORMAL FEATURES:
 ---------------
       1) counts all current tabs, then removes all tabs
       2) removes any unneeded trailing spaces or tabs
       2) places tabs every 8 columns wherever possible as long as
	       there is more than 1 space.
       3) optionally selects between ASCII text and .ASM source code
	    a) If .ASM is selected, does not attempt to put new tabs
	       in quoted DB strings and will replace a single space
	       with a tab until encountering a semicolon delimiter.


 DISPLAYS UPON COMPLETION:
 ------------------------
	       total lines in the file

		  original spaces
		  original tabs

		  current  spaces
		  current  tabs
		  trailing spaces deleted


 WHY THE TWO CHOICES:
 -------------------
       The .ASM source code version will not compress spaces into tabs
       between "quotes", in any DB strings.  As the ASCII text version
       will be processed by a normal display and/or printer routine it
       does compress spaces, wherever possible.

 To use:

       B>TABS HELLO.TXT 		  (1)
       B>TABS HELLO.DOC NUNAME.DOC	  (2)
       B>TABS A:HELLO.TXT		  (3)
       B>TABS A:HELLO.ASM B:NUNAME.ASM	(4)

   (1)	Sets tabs in a file named HELLO.TXT.  When finished the original
	  file is named HELLO.BAK and the new file has the normal name.
   (2)	The original file keeps the original name.  The new file is now
	  named NUNAME.DOC.
   (3)	Just shows you can use two disks.  The backup file will be on
	  the same disk as the original and assumes the original name..
   (4)	The original file remains intact, the new file is on another
	  drive and is named NUNAME.ASM.
