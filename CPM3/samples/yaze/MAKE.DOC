	SYNTAX

		make [-f makefile] [-nprst] [macro=val ...] [target(s) ...]

	WHERE

		-i means don't continue if an error is encountered

		-f specifies that the following argument is the name of
		   a makefile to be used instead of default "MAKEFILE.DAT"
		   or "MAKEFILE".

		-n means don't execute the commands, just write the ones that
		   would be executed to the standard output. 

		-p Print all macros & targets

		-r Do not use inbuilt rules

		-s Make silently

		-t Touch files instead of making them

	"macro" -  is a macro name, and...

	  "val" -  is the string value to set it to.  Use quotes around
	           the "macro=val" if there are imbedded spaces.


	DESCRIPTION

		This program is a slightly simplified clone of the UNIX
		(tm of AT&T) utility of the same name.  Dependancy
		information is extracted from a makefile and acted upon.

		This version requires CP/M-80 version 3.0 ("CP/M PLUS")
		with time-of-day-clock implemented.  Also the file timestamps
		must be "turned on". Current time-of-day call to CP/M is
	        also used.  Note that "CP/M" is a trademark of Digital
	 	Research.



	MAKEFILE FORMAT

		For general usage, refer to a UNIX(tm) man-page.

	        "Make" without parameters makes the first target in the
		makefile.

		The default name of the 'makefile' is 'MAKEFILE.DAT'
		or 'MAKEFILE' in that order.  If the '-f' option is used,
		the default makefile is not processed.
	
		Any blank lines in the 'makefile(s)' are ignored, as are
		lines that have a "#" in the first column.




  MAKE(CPM+)			-2-			   MAKE(CPM+)

	
	
	 	Lines starting with a tab character are 'howto'
		lines, and consist of a command name followed by arguments.

		Any other line is a 'dependency' line.  'Dependency'
		lines consist of a filename followed by a (possibly empty)
		list of dependent filenames.  A colon is required after
		the target filename.
	
	 	'Howto' lines apply to the most	recently preceding 
		'dependency' line.  It is improper for 	a 'howto' line
		 to precede the first 'dependency' line.

		Lines ending with "\" join the next-line to the current
		one with all but one-character of the next-line's leading
		whitespace removed.


	SIDE EFFECTS

		This program works by producing a temporary file "MAKE@@@.SUB"
		then chaining to it for execution of the command list.  This
		file then deletes itself upon successful completion.  Should
		the execution be aborted, then this file will remain
		in the file system (but will not harm later invocations of
		make).

		Everything has been made case-independent (CP/M forces command
		lines upper case.  That makes this case-independence a
		requirement.)

        BUGS
		The -i option is opposite of "normal" so that error codes
		are normally ignored.  If the -i option is used, colons
		will proceed commands that aren't to execute after an
		error.  This sortof almost works in CP/M Plus.  To be
		made to work three things need to be done. 1) an RSX
		written that makes a compiler(etc) set the error flag (should
		be easy to do). 2) Keep CP/M 3.0 and/or the CCP from resetting
		the error flag on each command that is executed (patch
		somewhere?), and 3) Let the ":" exclusion work in front
		of .SUB files as well as .COM files (patch somewhere?).
		Discription of the ":" is in the CP/M Plus Programmer's
		Guide in the description of bdos function 108.

	RULES
		The built in rules currently are these:
		
		".o" files depend on ".c" files and are made by:
			$(CCC) $(CFLAGS) $(CWHICH)
			
			where:
				CCC    = cc-c   (mdk's submit file)
				CFLAGS = 	(they are in cc-c.sub)
				CWHICH = $*     (target's basename)


		".rel" files depend on ".asm" files and are made by:
			$(ASM) $(ASMWHICH) $(ASMFLAGS)

			where:
				ASM      = rmac
				ASMWHICH = $*
				ASMFLAGS = $$PZ SZ

		Note: These macros can be redefined in the makefile.
