Hello Victor,

...

You want to know how you can use the CP/M-programm Z80ASM inside the 
yaze-ag Emulator.

Bevore I discuss this I want to say you that you have to transfere
your assembler-source to a CP/M-disk which is used by the emulator.
You can use the cdm utility to transfere between a CP/M-Disk and unix.
Cdm (CP/M disk manager) is part of yaze-ag.
See "man cdm" to look to the commands and use the help command
about the "cp" command inside cdm ("help cp") to see how you can copy
and convert Unix files to CP/M files.

The Z80ASM:

Z80ASM is a comercial product by SLR.
I load the Z80ASM from www.retroarchive.org[/cpm/lang/lang.htm] there is
many commercial software for CP/M-80. There you find also Z80ASM in the file
SLRASM.ZIP. Inside the archive there is also the CONFIG.COM for the Z80ASM.COM.
There is also the archive SLR_MAN.ZIP with the dokumentation for Z80ASM.

I have a documentation for the SLR180+ (a further development of Z80ASM) but
the most options are idendically with the Z80ASM.

The assembler uses the source file format which is used also by
M80 (Microsoft).

Syntax of Z80ASM:

	Z80ASM [filename][/options][,[filename][/options][,[filename][/op]]]]

Command line options are used to modify the default operating
characteristics of Z80ASM.

SLASH OPTION SUMMARY:

	A :	absolute mode. Output file is COM.

	C :	default output to the console

	D :	don't do LOWER to UPPER case conversion.

	E :	execute LOWER to UPPER case conversion.

	F :	selects full listing (2 passes through source)

	H :	generate HEX file as output

	K :	kill all console I/O and detach

	L :	list output partial (1 pass through source).

	M :	generate microsoft rel file as output

	N :	new OPTION byte.

	P :	enables output to the list device.

	R :	generate standard rel (SLR format) file as output.

	S :	generate alphabetized symbol table.

	T :	input time and date string

	U :	declares undefined symbols as external.

	X :	generates cross-reference.

	Y :	disable cross-reference

	6 :	selects M-Rel output, 6 significant.

	7 :	selects M-Rel output, 7 significant.


Some options (long form):

	A	The A option selects absolute mode operation and a
		default output file type of COM.

	F	The F option selects FULL listing mode. This option
		forces Z80 ASM into 2-pass mode, generating a 
		listing output on the second pass to the appropriate
		device. Note that by default the disk driver is enabled.

	H	The H option selects absolute mode and binary output
		type compatible with the Intel HEX format.
		This output may be directed directly to the CON or
		LST devices for output straight to an ICE or PROM
		programmer.

	L	The L option selects one-pass listing mode. This
		listing is similar to the F-mode fill listing
		expect that forward references list as undefined
		in the fenerated code columns. Note that by default
		the output will go to the same disk drive as the
		source file.

	M	The M option forcees relocatable mode. The binary
		output file has the default extension REL, and the
		format generated is compatible with the microsoft
		releocatable format.

	P	The P option makes the PRINTER or CP/M list device
		output driver the default output for listing-type
		outputs. Any Listing, symbol table, or crossreference
		output selected will be sent to the CP/M list device
		by default.

	R	The R option is used to select relocatable operation.
		The output file is REL, and the format generated is
		SLR Format.

	S	The S option selects the generation of an alphabetized
		symbol table. The output goes to the disk device by
		default. The output contains symbol names, types, and
		values. The number of symbols per line depends on the
		selected page width and the number of significdant 
		characters selected.

	T	The T option is used to specify a time and date string
		for use in generating listings. Any following characters
		(up to 16) up to the next comma, semicolon or carriage
		return are used as the time and date string. This option
		must used as the last slash option.

	U	The U option (ignored in absolute mode) instructs Z80ASM
		to automatically declare any UNDEFINED labels as externals
		to beresolved by the linker. LOCAL labels CANNOT be external.

	X	The X option selects cross-reference generation. This
		option forces two-pass mode (/F), and the output will
		go on the end of the listing file, or optionally to a 
		seperate file (see config.com).

	6	The 6 option performs an implied M option, and selects
		6 significant character generation for globals and
		externals. This overides the default selected by config.com.

	7	The 7 option does the same as 6 expects that Z80 ASM will
		generate 7 significant characters for globals and externals.

Z80ASM generate M-REL format (option 7) by default.

If you start Z80ASM without a file, it goes in an interactive mode. There
you can assemble also more than one assembler source. You stops the Z80ASM
with CTRL-C (or Strg-C).

So I hope this is enought and you can use Z80ASM.

If you use the microsoft rel format you can use the L80 (microsoft) or
the LINK.COM (Digital Research) to link to a COM-file.
See the Y.SUB on drive P: (BIOS-Souce files) for an example where I compile
all BIOS-files with Z80ASM and link all (with the linker of Digital Research
(LINK.COM)) to BNKBIOS3.SPR.
You find the syntax of LINK.COM with "HELP LINK" if the emulator runs.
I mean you find the syntax of L80 also on www.retroarchive.org.

If you have more questions write an email to me.
If you find an Error in yaze-ag, let me know about it.

Good luck :-)
