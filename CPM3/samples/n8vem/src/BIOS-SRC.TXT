Banked CP/M 3.0 For the N8VEM Single Board Computer

This library contains the CP/M 3.0 bios source code for the N8VEM Single Board Computer

The bios uses the modular approach as detailed in the CP/M 3.0 system manual.

Most of the files are derived from the example bios as distributed with CP/M 3

The following files are specific for the N8VEM SBC:

CHARIO.ASM	-	Contains comm port drivers (currently only console)
DRVTBL.ASM	-	Contains logical drive assignment
MDN8V.ASM	-	Memory disk driver (ROM and RAM drives)
ECIDE.ASM	-	N8VEM IDE disk driver
ECFDC.ASM	-	N8VEM Floppy Disk driver

LDRBIOSE.ASM	Basic IDE bios for CPMLDR.COM

BUILD.SUB	-	Submit file to assemble sources


Assembling the BIOS
-------------------

The bios supports both banked and non-banked operation.  There is an if statement
at the beginning of most of the files.  The default is banked.  If you want non-banked
just changed the condition.

You need to have a working CP/M 2.2 or CP/M 3 system which is compatible with
CP/M 3's expectations.  There is a CP/M 2.2 ROMIMAGE in the CPM3BASE.LBR if required.

Step 1.
-------
Extract all the files in the library to the C: drive using the following command:

NULU -O BIOS-SRC.LBR -E *.* -X

Step 2.
-------
Execute the commands in the BUILD.SUB file either manually or using SUBMIT

Step 3.
-------
Create the CPM3.SYS file using the GENCPM.COM application.  The supplied GENCPM.DAT file
contains the defaults I used to build the system.

A new CPM3.SYS file will be created ready for booting by CPMLDR.

Note:  Once you start GENCPM is immediately overwrites the CPM3.SYS file so make sure you have a backup.


Please give it a try and let me know if you have any questions, problems or feedback.
