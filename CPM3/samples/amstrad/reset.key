17 C "^'#83'"  This keyboard file adds a few extra key functions to Spectrum +3
17 E "^'#83'"  ZPM3. Changes are detailed below. 
E #83 "^S"
18 C "^'#84'"  There is an error in the +3 manual. It states that INV VIDEO is 
E #84 "^Q"     defined as ^I. This is true initially, but RESET.KEY defines it
18 E "^I"      as ^Q. This means after a SETKEYS RESET.KEY, RPED doesn't work.  
35 C "^'#8A'"  This has been fixed here so that SYMSHIFT+INV VIDEO is ^I and 
E #8A "^'#1B'" will work in RPED instead of INV VIDEO.
