                              VINSTALL 2.50 BUG:


PROBLEM:  Using VINSTALL to load a .VDE (.VDM) file doesn't work, because it 
         loads in 16 bytes too low in the memory image.  (There's nothing 
         wrong with the .VDE file itself.)

SOLUTION: (1) Use MLOAD or similar utility to install the .VDE file at an 
             offset of 50H from the start of VDE.COM

          (2) Use a debugger to patch VINST25.COM as follows:
             Find         0250: 11 4D 24      LD DE,244D
             And change to      11 5D 24      LD DE,245D
