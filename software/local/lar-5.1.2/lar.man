       _l_a_r is a Unix program to manipulate CP/M _L_U format libraries. The orig-
       inal CP/M library program _L_U is the product of Gary P. Novosielski. The
       primary   use   of  _l_a_r  is  to  combine  several  files  together  for
       upload/download to a personal computer.

       This version of _l_a_r has been rewritten to match version 5  of  the  LBR
       format definition, and supports date stamps, CRCs and exact file sizes.

       The biggest problem is text files, the programs tries  to  detect  text
       files  vs.  binaries by checking for non-Ascii (8th bit set) chars.  If
       the file is text then it will throw away  Control-Z  chars  which  CP/M
       puts on the end.  All files in library are padded with Control-Z at the
       end to the CP/M sector size if necessary.

       No effort is made to handle the difference between CP/M and Unix end of
       line  chars.   CP/M  uses Cr/Lf and Unix just uses Lf.  The solution is
       just to use the Unix command sed when necessary.
