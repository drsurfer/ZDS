ZCPR3 utility to "move" a file from one directory to another on 
the same disk, with inspect and quiet modes, COPY-compatible 
command line options, and error flag setting.  Default options 
configurable via ZCNFG.  Version 2.4 fixes a bug and adds option 
to include or exclude system files.  Types 3 and 4 included.  Not 
for Z3Plus.
