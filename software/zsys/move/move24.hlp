MOVE is a ZCPR3 utility to "move" a file from one directory to another on 
the same disk.  It has inspect and quiet modes, sets the program error 
flag on error, and optionally moves only files that do not already exist in 
the destination directory.  MOVE cannot be used under Z3Plus.

                                   USAGE 


     MOVE {dir:}afn {dir{:}} {{/}options}


The source file and the destination directory must be on the same drive.  
If no DIR or DU specification is given, the current drive and user are 
assumed.

MOVE operates by changing the user number of the file's directory entry.  
The file itself is not copied or moved.
:O

                                  OPTIONS 

A leading slash is required only if the options are not the third token in 
the command tail, but is allowed in any case.

     E    erase any existing file with the same name in the destination 
          directory without prompting.  Ordinarily MOVE prints "exists, 
          Erase?" before overwriting an existing file.  Option "O" will 
          also work here.

     N    do not move the file if a file with the same name exists in the 
          destination directory.  Ordinarily MOVE would prompt you if it 
          found an existing file.  This option has priority over option E 
          above.

     I    inspect mode.  MOVE prompts for each matching filename.  Type "Y" 
          to move the file, "Q" or ^C to quit the program, or any other key 
          to skip the file and continue.

OPTIONS (continued)

     S    Include system (hidden) files.  Ordinarily, files with the system 
          attribute set are ignored by MOVE.

     Q    quiet mode.  Only error messages and required prompts are 
          displayed on the console.  This option toggles the current 
          default.  If the ZCPR3 quiet flag is set, "Q" on the command line 
          will switch MOVE to verbose mode; otherwise, it puts MOVE in 
          quiet mode.

All options can be configured as defaults (see CONFIGURATION).  In that 
case, the command line option will toggle to the non-default mode.

The interaction between options E and N can seem confusing if either is 
changed from its distributed default.  Just remember that the N option is 
checked first, with the E option being checked only if appropriate.
:E

                                  ERRORS 

On error the ZCPR3 program error flag is set as follows:

    255   user abort (configurable)
     19   invalid option
     10   no matching source file found
      4   no vacant user area (which is required) or Z3Plus (MOVE cannot 
          run under that system)
      2   invalid directory

The error handler, if one is running, will be invoked for all errors.  
Whether a user abort is considered an error is configurable.
:C

                               CONFIGURATION 

Although several configuration options are available, MOVE should be ready 
to run "as is" for most users.

Configuration changes are made with ZCNFG and the accompanying MOVEnn.CFG 
file.  If the name of the configuration file is not changed, ZCNFG will 
always be able to find it, even if the name of MOVE is changed to something 
else.  Full explanations for the various configuration options are 
available on the ZCNFG help screens.

All command line options are toggles and can be configured as the defaults. 
The command line options may then be used to toggle to whatever is the non- 
default state.

Version 2.4 -- November 24, 1992 -- Gene Pizzetta
     "S" option now used to include or exclude system files.  Old option 
     "O" still available as synonym for option "E".  Corrected bug in 
     inspect mode, found by Howard Goldstein, which caused the program to 
     be aborted sometimes by the BDOS when "No" was selected.

Version 2.3 -- October 30, 1992 -- Gene Pizzetta
     More robust check for Z-System.  Corrected check for CP/M Plus (BDOS 
     returns 31h, not 30h).  No longer prints "NoName" if DU has no name.  
     Added "E" option to erase existing file at destination and "N" to skip 
     the move if file exists at destination.  Old options "O" and "S", 
     respectively, still work.  Old "Q" option, which did nothing anyway, 
     now toggles quiet mode.  Added "I" inspect mode option.  Also obeys 
     quiet flag.  These option changes make MOVE more compatible with COPY 
     and other Z utilities.  Now reports number of files moved and can be 
     configured to print this report even in quiet mode.  All command line 
     options configurable as defaults.  Slash no longer required before 
     options if they are the third token on the command line.  Can now 
     abort ("Q" or ^C) at any prompt.  Intelligent help screen shows 
     current effect of options.  On error invokes error handler and sets 
     program error flag as follows:  19 = invalid option; 2 = invalid 
     directory; 10 = no matching source file found; 255 (FFh) = user abort; 
     4 = Z3Plus (we cannot run under that system) or no vacant user area 
     (which is required).  Can be configured to consider user abort as an 
     error or not.  Configuration via ZCNFG.  Thanks to Howard Goldstein 
     for his beta testing.

Version 2.2 -- December 4, 1989 -- Howard Goldstein
     Fixed bug in handling of large files.  Needed to set S2, not s1 wild.  
     Modified move algorithm for increased speed.  Now uses "search next" 
     and does only one write per directory sector per file instead of 
     possibly four.  Cleaned up command line parsing code.  Removed special 
     handling for stand-alone user numbers as DUSCAN seems to do it right.  
     Shortened code in SCANER: and fixed IFCBG: to work with extended 
     environment.  Shortened code in several other places as well.  Added a 
     call to FRESET just before deleting a file in the destination area to 
     avoid problems when running under DRI BDOS.  Added conditional 
     assembly for type 4.

Version 2.1B -- December 31, 1987 -- Bruce Morgen
     "B" version, one Bridger hint, one bug fix.  Wildcard to both extent 
     bytes before file existence test in "mainloop:", clear carry flag 
     before the "sbc hl,de" a little after the call to "eval10".

Version 2.1A --	December 30, 1987 -- Bruce Morgen
     "A" version, incorporated Bridger's FRESET

Version 2.1 -- December 28, 1987 -- Bruce Morgen
     ZCPR33 Type 3 format with safety header, search for an empty user area 
     instead of bombing out everything in user 31, established DSEG - with 
     initialization to assure predictable re-entrance.  Fixed wildcard FCB 
     (had too many "?"s).  Allow legitimate DU/DIR destination specs 
     without colons, ditto standalone user numbers.  Added intelligent help 
     message (change name to MAKE or MV, help also changes).  Scanning code 
     ATTEMPTS to following all Z33/BGii stipulations where applicable....

Version 2.0 -- February 28, 1986 -- Joe Wright
     Fixed drive selection bug. Add Query as default option.  Report 
     directories in DU:DIR form.
