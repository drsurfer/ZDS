How often have you wanted to change a file's date stamps?  Well,
here's the answer: DATSTP displays or changes ZSDOS, Z3PLUS, and
DateStamper create and modify date stamps from the command line,
with very flexible syntax.  Type 3 (@ 100h, 8000h) and 4 versions
included, type and load address now shown in the program banner.
Version 1.9 replaces VLIB with much shorter ZSLIB34 routines.
This results in even big DATSTPU.4OM coming in at a modest 6K.
