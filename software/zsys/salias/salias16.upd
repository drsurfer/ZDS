SALIAS, Version 1.6b       Rob Friefeld             September 12, 1992

This update fixes some bugs in the "print to disk" routine. If the text 
file was output while the script was indent formatted, the indentations 
were not properly filtered. In addition, if the script had not yet been 
given a name, the text file had a blank filename. Now an output file name 
is requested explicitly. (These bugs reported by Howard Goldstein.)

For this distribution, the DOC file has been replaced by SALIAS.HLP.
