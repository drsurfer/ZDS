
Do not set both the U and the V options to "Yes"; they are mutually 
exclusive.  If both options are made the default, then the "no option" mode 
will be lost.  If either of the options is made the default mode, using 
either command line option will turn the mode off.

Option U -- Show user area usage.  As distributed, UMAP displays only brief 
total directory statistics, unless the "U" option is given on the command 
line.  If you would prefer complete user area directory statistics as the 
default, select "Yes" here.

Option V -- Show vacant user areas.  If you use UMAP chiefly to determine 
which user areas are free, you may wish to select "Yes" so that vacant user 
areas are displayed by default.

Option S -- Space vacant user display.  If "No", UMAP with the V option 
displays vacant user areas in compact form on the left side of the screen.  
"Yes" will add extra space to the display, spreading it the width of the 
screen.  It's your choice.
