A ZCPR3 utility to show a brief disk map -- which users have 
files and how many directory entries the files use, or only which 
users are empty, or just a brief summary of the number of used 
entries, free entries, and free disk space.  Types 1, 3 and 4 
included.  ZCNFG configuration.  Version 1.8 corrects a problem 
when running under BYE, with other very minor changes.
