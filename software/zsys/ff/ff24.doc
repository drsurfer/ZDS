                           Version 2.4
                            01/19/90


FF finds all files matching a list of file specs on all drives, a
specific drive, or a list of drives.  All file specs are
automatically made wild (that is, "A.B" becomes "A*.B*").

     FF [D: or DIR:]afn[,afn]... [d...][/o...]

Options (d) before the slash:

     List of drives to scan

Options (o) after the slash:

     E    Exact matches only (no auto wildcarding).

     P    No Paging of output.

     S    Toggle inclusion of System files based on default
          configuration (see below).  System files are never
          included unless the Wheel byte is set.

The program error flag set to 0ffh if no matching files are found,
or to 1 if the program is aborted by the user.

The number of matching files found is put in a register.  (By
default register 0 is used, but the register to be used can be
configured.  See below.)

If a drive or drive list is not included on the command line, the
drives set in the drive vector are automatically scanned. The first
drive, DU:, or DIR: reference in the list of files to seek restricts
the search to that drive only. Others, including the optional drive
list, are ignored. The drive specification may be part of ANY of the
file specifications and is NOT limited to being part of the first file
listed as implied by the Syntax description. (version 2.4)

The '/' before the non-drive options may be preceded by spaces,
and may be replaced with a space. Spaces may also be present
around the non-drive options.

FF24 is configurable with ZCNFG V1.7. Defaults for the three
command line non-drive options may be configured. The command line
options then toggle these defaults for the duration of a single
execution of FF. 

The list of drives (drive vector) is also configurable with ZCNFG, 
a major improvement over the former patching method. 

Two new default drive search vectors may be configured, one based
on the currently logged drives and the second based on drives
represented by entries in the current NDR (named directories).
The use of named directories may be subject to wheel byte status.
These configuration options are useful for ensuring system security
in a RAS environment, and for helping to prevent access to empty
floppy drives.

Help screens in the configuration file give more details of the 
options and their configuration.

FF was derived from FINDF version 26.  FINDF was originally
created by Richard Conn.  See the history in FINDF for a
chronology of contributions by others, including Howard
Goldstein, Joe Wright, Al Hawley, Rick Peterson, and Bruce
Morgen.  I have given this program the new name FF so that it can
develop in different directions without interfering with
Echelon's need to support the utilities it provides with its
commercial versions of Z-System.

Version 2.4x3 -- 19 Jan 91, by Al Hawley
     Added configuration option to restrict search to named
     directories for non-wheels and within drive map constraints.
     Passworded directories are not searched.

     Modified pagination algorithm so that the 'more' message is
     not issued when there is no more to display. This happened in
     previous versions when the display exactly filled the screen.

     Added option to remove display of "DISC --" title lines.

     Revised drive select option logic for functional modularity
     and logical conciseness.

     Revised memory allocation so that the FN table and the ORDER
     table are dynamically sized to minimize memory usage.

     Replaced filename parsing code in GETFN with a call to ZFNAME
     from Z3LIB. Removed unneccessary code and optimized code in
     a number of places. Moved all code for console display from
     other routines into the PRFILES routine. Simplified memory
     allocation by using Z3LIBs GZMTOP routine.

Version 2.4x2 -- 3 Jan 91  Joe Wright
     Provided code for Type 1 or Type 3 header.
     Removed code to save/restore current drive (not needed).
     Use ANDHD and ORHD from SYSLIB in a couple of places.
     Help screen to show drives like AB_D_. instead of ABD.

Version 2.4x1 -- Al Hawley, 12/30/90 (x1 means Beta version 1)
     FF24 has been made configurable with ZCNFG, per Howard's 
     prompting. The current configuration option settings are 
     reflected in the HELP screen. Changed the drive vector back
     to the structure used by BDOS and the ZCPR3x extended env.
     The 'human' oriented structure is no longer needed now that
     ZCNFG makes it easy and natural to modify the drive vector.

     Most of the sorting code has been removed and replaced 
     with calls to the sort routines in SYSLIB4C. These new 
     syslib routines are MUCH faster than the old ones.

     The source has been extensively edited, with a view toward
     better readability. Archaic comments were removed, and some
     new ones added where comprehension could be enhanced.

     The command line syntax has been relaxed a bit to allow 
     white space AFTER the drive list, and the '/' before the 
     option field may be replaced with white space. 

     Included Z3PLUS code optimization from the unreleased
     version 2.3 which deletes unnecessary BIOS selects.
     
Version 2.3 -- Never released
Version 2.2 -- Howard Goldstein, January 12, 1990
     Modified exit logic so that the number of files found is
     placed in the regiter even when the program is aborted by the
     user.  The error flag is set to 1 on user abort.
     Rewrote Gene Pizzetta's fixes from version 2.1 to get the COM
     file back down to 3k.
     Fixed logic to allow one more line on first screen of paged
     output.

Version 2.1 -- Gene Pizzetta, December 30, 1989
     Added configuration byte (SYSF label in first record) to
     include or exclude SYStem files as the default.  A non-zero
     value causes system files to be included, but the byte will
     be ignored if the wheel byte is off.  "S" option now toggles
     current default.  Help screen modified to reflect default
     setting.  Created quick and dirty doc file from source code
     header and history (mainly so source code would fit into
     memory under ZDE).

Version 2.0 -- Howard Goldstein, November 26, 1989
     Fixed a bug which caused duplicate listing of files larger
     than 32 extents.

Version 1.9 -- Carson Wilson, March 18, 1989
     Release version.  Cleaned up code.  Carson Wilson may be
     reached at Antelope Freeway RAS, 312-764-5162, Chicago,
     where he is SYSOP.

Version 1.8 -- Carson Wilson, March 9, 1989
     Corrected check against the MAXDRV byte in the environment
     descriptor.  Previous code allowed one drive beyond MAXDRV.
     Extracted new MASK routine from INIT so that it can be
     called after any drive options are processed.  This enforces
     the valid drive vector from the environment descriptor
     regardless of the setting of the MAXDRV byte.  Thanks to
     Howard Goldstein for discovering both of these faults.

Version 1.7 -- Carson Wilson, March 4, 1989
     Fixed up bug created in version 1.6 which caused "FF /"
     command to list all files.  Also made help command more
     restrictive: only "FF" or "FF<one or more spaces>//"
     (exactly) now give help - other commands (e.g., "FF /" or
     "FF // ") are interpreted as filespecs.

     Planned enhancements:  Make the drive vector into a word for
     easier coding.  Create a .CFG file to allow use of Al
     Hawley's ZCNFG menu-driven installer with FF.

Version 1.6 -- Carson Wilson, March 2, 1989
     Following Bridger Mitchell's suggestion, Help is no longer
     generated by a single slash as a parameter, allowing files
     beginning with the slash character to be searched for.  Also
     changed page prompt to reflect multiple abort keys (says
     "RETURN=page" instead of "OTHER=page").

Version 1.5 -- Carson Wilson, February 26, 1989
     Added "REG#" ASCII pointer to the patch byte controlling
     which register is used to store the number of matches found.
     The default is register zero.  Change the register by
     substituting a BINARY value from 1 to 9 at this storage
     location.  Following Howard's suggestion, FF now allows all
     abort characters for all abort tests, instead of just the
     interpage abort test.

Version 1.4 -- Carson Wilson, February 23, 1989
     Now allows abort with ^C, c, C, ^K, k, K, ^X, x, or X
     between pages of paged output.

Version 1.41x -- Howard Goldstein, February 18, 1989
     Fixed use of system valid drive vector.  It is now logically
     ANDed with the table in the program.

Version 1.3 -- Bridger Mitchell, July 4, 1988
     Exit with BIOS, then BDOS drive-select.

Version 1.2 -- Bridger Mitchell, February 29, 1988
     Added extended environment valid-drive vector.

Version 1.1 -- Bridger Mitchell, November 14, 1987
     Added CP/M 3 compatibility.  Converted directory searches to
     BDOS calls, for compatibility with DosDisk and other BDOS
     emulators.  Removed IX register use, for compatibility with
     BIOS/DOS systems that mistakenly fail to preserve z80
     registers.  Added check for presence of external
     environment.  Uses full TPA if CCP is protected.  Search
     every valid BIOS drives whose bit is set in the DRVTBL;
     previous versions aborted on the first invalid drive.

Version 1.0 -- Jay Sage, March 14, 1987
     Added the DRVTBL configuration word at the beginning of the
     code.  This word contains a bit for each possible drive in
     a system.  When the user has not indicated a specific drive
     to scan, each drive is checked against this table and
     skipped if the bit is not set.  This allows FF to work in
     systems with holes (e.g., drives A, B, and F) in which the
     BIOS hangs when a drive is accessed that does not exist or
     has no disk in it.  As distributed, FF has FFFFH in this
     word so that all drives up to the max drive specified in the
     environment will be scanned.

     Added more flexibility to output paging.  The output can be
     paged a line at a time by hitting the space bar or can be
     aborted at a page break by hitting control-C.

     Enhanced syntax to allow specifying a list of drives to be
     scanned in the option field.

     Added code to set program error flag if no files found and
     to clear the flag if files were found.  The number of files
     found is stored in a configurable user register.  If the
     number is more than 255, the value 255 is stored.  As
     distrubuted, register 0 is used.

     Added code to treat all file specs as ambiguous.  Thus,
     "FF A" is equivalent to "FF A*.*" and "FF A.B" is equivalent
     to "FF A*.B*".  This feature can be disabled with the E
     option.
