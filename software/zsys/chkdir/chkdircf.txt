
Option W -- Warm boot.  As distributed CHKDIR avoids overwriting the 
command processor so it can make a simple return on exit.  If your disk 
directories are so large that CHKDIR runs out of memory, you can gain a 
little space by answering "Yes", which will allow the CCP to be overwritten 
and cause a warm boot on exit.

Option N -- Null files.  While reading a directory CHKDIR always reports 
the names of null (zero-length) files, but it does not include such files 
in its directory checking routines because programs such as SAP erase such 
files by default.  If you want the checking routines to include null files, 
answer "Yes" here.

Options T and H -- Tag character.  These options have no effect unless 
Option N is "Yes".  The tag character is the first character of disk 
labels, such as those used by cataloging programs.  The character is 
usually "-", "#", or "!".  If a tag character is configured, disk labels 
will not be checked, even if Option N is "Yes" so that other null files 
will be checked (important if you use lower-case disk labels).  If you 
don't want disk labels skipped, make this option a null (^@).  If a null 
can't be generated by your keyboard, use Option H to enter it in 
hexadecimal.
