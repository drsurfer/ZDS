			     PPIP19
			     ------
CHANGES SINCE PPIP18
--------------------
Support for CP/M 3 and its methods of time stamping and exact file lengths
added. These files have PPIP18 as their direct ancestor.

READY-TO-RUN
------------
The PPIP.COM file is ready to run on a normal CP/M 80 system.  It does
not have the ZCPR3, DATESTAMP, Z80DOS or CPM3 options turned on.

The PPIP-C3.COM file is ready to run on a normal CP/M Plus system.  It does
not have the ZCPR3, DATESTAMP, or Z80DOS options turned on.

The PPIP-Z.COM file is ready to run on a ZCPR3 or ZCPR33 system and has
the DATESTAMP turned on, also.

The PPIP-Z8.COM file is ready to run on a ZCPR3 or ZCPR33 system and has
the Z80DOS turned on, also.

ASSEMBLING
----------
If wishing to assemble the file, after extracting and uncrunching all
entries, edit the PPIP19.Z80 file.  There are four main options to set,
the ZCPR3 option, the DATSTMP option, the Z80DOS option and the CPM3 option.
You will likely not need to look at/change any other options.  Then just use
Z80ASM by SLR, ZAS or M80 to assemble the file.  The other files (like
PPIP-0.Z80, etc.) are "include" files which are automatically assembled when
you say:

		B>Z80ASM PPIP18 <ret>	    (SLR assembler)

      or
		B>M80 =PPIP18 <ret>

If using the M80 assembler you would then use L80 to change the resulting
PPIP18.REL file into a .COM file ready to use:

		B>L80 PPIP18,PPIP/N/E

to get a ready-to-run file named PPIP.COM.
